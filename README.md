#Migraine Type Prediction

#Overview

This project aims to predict migraine types based on user-inputted symptoms and medical history using a machine learning model trained with a Random Forest Classifier. The project is built using Python and Streamlit for an interactive web-based interface.

#Features

Loads and preprocesses migraine-related data from a CSV file.

Encodes categorical data using Label Encoding.

Scales numerical features using MinMaxScaler.

Trains a Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Provides predictions and preventive measures for different types of migraines.

Allows users to enter symptom data via a Streamlit UI.

Displays additional information about migraine triggers, types, and treatment options.
